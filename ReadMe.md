This is just a small project to learn about Lucene.NET and to see if can be added to query DDD projections.  The base code was taking from a Code Project post at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/320219/Lucene-Net-ultra-fast-search-for-MVC-or-WebForms.  The original code from the post can be found at https://github.com/mikhail-tsennykh/Lucene.Net-search-MVC-sample-site.
